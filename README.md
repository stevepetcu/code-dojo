A code dojo is a **facilitated learning environment** for the **deliberate practice** of programming.

We practice **collaborating to write good code**, under **safe circumstances**. 

The practice sessions must be **focused**, **goal-oriented** group activities, which allow participants to **stretch** the limits of their comfort zone, and receive quick **feedback**.

Between sessions, trainees are to **reflect** on their performance and how to **improve** it.
